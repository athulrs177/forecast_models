# INSTALLATION

Python package to generate deterministic forecasts of rainfall amounts using Gamma Regression and CNN models. 

Install using pip: ```pip install git+https://github.com/athulrs177/forecast_models.git```

# RUNNING THE MODEL

For running the example jupyter-notebook given, you will need a machine with 13 logical CPUs and ~40 GB of memory in the case of Gamma Regression model and 40 logical CPUs and ~120 GB of memory in the case of CNN model. Weaker machines may also work provided enough memory to load the data, but performance may be poorer. No GPU is required.
